In this project, for backend, I used Node.js, express.js and MongoDB database. 

React.js is used for frontend. 

I followed industrial standard of project developemnt and deployemnt be it dividing the code in smaller and reusable segments and components along with files and folders arranemnt in such a way that it becomes very easy to 
understand to anyone.

Vercel platform is used for frontend deployment and Reder is used for server deployment.
