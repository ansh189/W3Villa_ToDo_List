Note: If for the first time you are opening the FRONTEND URL LINK, it will take around few seconds or 1 min to get response from server as redner is a free hosting platform thats why it works slow and takes some time.
So keep patience to get response form server side.

In this project, for backend, I used Node.js, express.js and MongoDB database. 

React.js is used for frontend. 

I followed industrial standard of project developemnt and deployemnt be it dividing the code in smaller and reusable segments and components along with files and folders arranemnt in such a way that it becomes very easy to 
understand to anyone.

I focused to maintain code quality and handling each anf every error along with informing the user using react-hot-toast react library.

Vercel platform is used for frontend deployment and Reder is used for server deployment.
